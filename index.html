    <p>
      Cheesecake is a rich, creamy dessert made from a smooth mixture of cream
      cheese, eggs, and sugar, typically set atop a buttery graham cracker
      crust. It can be baked or chilled, and often features toppings like fresh
      fruit, chocolate drizzle, or whipped cream. Its velvety texture and sweet
      tang make it a beloved treat across cultures and occasions.
